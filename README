This is a part of the Open Secure Telephony Network project: https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN

All of the necessary technologies and communications standards exist today for
voice communications that is as secure as OpenPGP email. Many proprietary and
open source solutions exist for desktop and mobile devices that already
implement the necessary bits to provide a solution many times more secure than
Skype, without dependence upon one global service provider. Yet people who are
security conscious enough to use Skype to secure their computer based
conversations will still hold sensitive discussion on mobile phones. The
problem is simplicity, usability and reliability.

This project will provide an application for Android phones that will be only
marginally more complex to use than dialing an existing phone number, while
still being based entirely on open standards. The app itself is based on
existing open source client code provided by the CSipSimple, pjsip and ZORG
projects. We will coordinate with a network of audited, open service providers
around the world who already provide free and commercial service to users, to
ensure our users have an automated provisioning process to get connected.

I'm looking for help automating this webapp installation with a Chef cookbook.

Webapp Install:

  # install binary deps
	apt-get install ruby1.9.1-dev rubygems1.9 libsqlite3-dev
  # install bundler via rubygems
  gem install bundler
  git clone git://github.com/guardianproject/OSTel.git
  cp -r OSTel/webapp /usr/local/freeswitch
  chown -R freeswitch:freeswitch /usr/local/freeswitch/webapp
  cd OSTel/webapp/
  bundle install
  # set production environment variable
  export RAILS_ENV=production
  # build database schema
  rake db:migrate
  # start server
  rails server -e production
  # check your site in a browser!
  # it should probably not look that good because Rails 3 doesn't serve static
  # files
  # run unicorn (add the -D option to run in the background)
  unicorn -o 127.0.0.1 -p 3000 --env production
  # install nginx to proxy requests
  apt-get install nginx
  # configure SSL
  http://www.openssl.org/docs/HOWTO/certificates.txt
  # configure nginx
  http://gist.github.com/
  # configure rails
  vim config/environments/production.rb
    config.freeswitch_dir = ""
    config.domain = ""
    config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => '' }
  vim config/initializers/devise.rb
    config.mailer_sender = "signup@example.com"
  vim config/initializers/smtp_settings.rb
