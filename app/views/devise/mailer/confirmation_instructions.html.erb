<p>Thank you so much for joining our efforts to make a friendlier and more secure telephone network. We here at Guardian Project are calling it OSTel, as in "Open Secure Telephony."</p>

<p>This installation will take you 3 minutes. Literally. Let's get you started... and finished. Your credentials can be found by logging into your account.</p>
