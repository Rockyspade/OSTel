            <p>Ostel is a tool for having end-to-end encrypted phone calls.
            Our goal is to promote the use of free, open protocols, standards
            and software, to power end-to-end secure voice communications on
            mobile devices, as well as with desktop computers.</p>

          <h1>Development</h1>					
          <p><a href="https://guardianproject.info/" target="_blank">The
          Guardian Project</a> is a research and development effort powered by
          technology-focused activists, concerned citizen users, and open-source
          security software hackers. We build tools based on real-world
          experience and feedback. Our process is transparent, inclusive and
          responsible.</p>					
          <p><a href="https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/ostel/wiki/Server_Documentation">Documentation
          and source code</a> for building your own service like ostel.co is available.
          We encourage anyone with Linux system skills to host their own backend to
become part of a global federated secure VoIP network.</p>

          <h2>Open Secure Telephone Network (OSTN)</h2>

          <p>We are working to define a defacto standard called <a href="https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/ostn/wiki/Wiki">OSTN</a> by which a
          voice over internet protocol service can be considered
          end-to-end secured, with verifiable encryption, minimal logging,
          and a decentralised model of deployment and use. From this
          standard, we will work to deploy a network of compliant
          server/service instances and client software, mobile and
          desktop, that are federated, audited and interoperable.</p>
