Guardian Project welcomes you to the open secure telephony future.

***Setting up OSTel***

After you install the app on your mobile device with your account information, you can test that
everything is working by calling the user code named 9196. In
this echo test, you should hear your own voice when you speak into the
phone. You should also see "ZRTP - OK" in the yellow bar near the top
of the screen, letting you know that the encryption is working. Now
you can place free and secure calls to your friends who also have
Ostel set up. To ensure maximum security, confirm that the same
4-digit encryption code appears on both phones. 

Tell your friends to give you a free call on your own personal Batphone, <%= @user.sip_username %>>
